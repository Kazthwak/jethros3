# JETHROS3
They say "third time's the charm"...
This will be a 32-bit higher-half kernel.
I decided it would be easier to restart rather than trying to rearrange my old OS. It will also make the OS cleaner, I am sure.
It *should* be easy as well, after all, I have done it before. Absolutely *no* chance this will end up being really difficult.
I am also kind of hoping that I can avoid copy-pasting completely this time (although it was not very much last time). Time will tell.
