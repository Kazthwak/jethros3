This, could be tricky.
The device is booted from a drive 0
Each drive is given a mount number (0-0xff)
Each partition is given a sub-number (0-0xff)
Currently only one partition and drive are supported, so the root drive is always /0/0, and this is the only drive
/ is root, but only contains mounted drives
Each drive may contain only 16 partitions
Each partition has its own data block, detailing its filesystem etc
Therefore, a file's path can be used to infer all that needs to be known about it.
